5G-EmPOWER: Artificial Inteligence-empowered Mobile Operating System
====================================================================

### What is 5G-EmPOWER?
5G-EmPOWER is a near Real Time RAN Intelligent Controller (nRT-RIC) designed for heterogeneous wireless/mobile networks.

### Top-Level Features
* 5G-EmPOWER supports both LTE and Wi-Fi networks. Support for NR and ns3 is undergoing.
* 5G-EmPOWER provides well defined programming abstraction around mature AI/ML toolkits lowering the entrance barrier for researchers and practioners.
* 5G-EmPOWER provides a REST API and native (Python) API

This repository includes a Virtual Base Station emulator for 5G-EmPOWER which emulates some basic behaviour of a eNB/gNB with a handful of UEs starting from a scenario file. Please notice that this software is meant just for supporting the the development of 5G-EmPOWER and it is in no way meant to be a network emulator. It basically just emualtes the signalling between a VBS and the 5G-EmPOWER runtime.
